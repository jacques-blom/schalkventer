# Hello internet-friend!
   
**I'm a South African UI Designer/Front-end Developer, spending the majority of my time on the following:**

- 👪 Managing [Front-end Development South Africa (FEDSA)](https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds), a non-profit organisation I co-founded with my friends [@shailennaidoo](https://github.com/shailennaidoo) and [@justinslack](https://github.com/justinslack).
    
- 🌍 Exploring the intersection between technology, social good and civic-engagement alongside my friends at [Codebridge](https://www.meetup.com/Codebridge/) and [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/).

- 🦄 Doing freelance consultation and/or contract work on for clients.

_If you find any of the above interesting you might want to follow me here on Github - where all of this takes place._
