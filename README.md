# Hello internet-friend!
   
**I'm a South African UI Designer/Front-end Developer, spending the majority of my time on either of the following:**

- 🌍 Managing [Front-end Development South Africa (FEDSA))[https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds], a non-profit organisation I co-founded with two of my friends.
    
- 👪 Exploring the intersection between technology, social good and civic engagement alongside my friends at [Codebridge](https://www.meetup.com/Codebridge/) and [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/).

- 🦄 Doing freelance consultation and/or contract work on web projects.

_If you find any of the above interesting you might want to follow me on Github - where all of this takes place._
